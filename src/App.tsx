          <p>
            Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)
            <br />
            Measures current immune response against the virus. ALT level goes
            high when the immune system starts attacking the infected liver
            cells.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fibroscan or ultrasound
            <br />
            Measures the current liver damage. Over time, repeated damage to the
            liver causes scars (this is called fibrosis, or cirrhosis when it
            gets very bad). This scarring can be seen on ultrasound or
            fibroscan. Too much scarring will stop the liver from working
            properly. Ultrasound can also be used to find any liver tumours that
            are forming.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
            <br />
            Measures liver cancer risk. If this is high, it indicates there is a
            risk you have liver cancer. This has to be confirmed by other
            methods (like ultrasound) because there may be other reasons why AFP
            levels are high.
