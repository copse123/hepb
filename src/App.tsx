          <FAQItem title="Fibroscan or ultrasound">
            Measures the current liver damage. Over time, repeated damage to the
            liver causes scars (this is called fibrosis, or cirrhosis when it
            gets very bad). This scarring can be seen on ultrasound or
            fibroscan. Too much scarring will stop the liver from working
            properly. Ultrasound can also be used to find any liver tumours that
            are forming. Fibroscan usually shows the deeper layers of the liver,
            so it's better to use it to see the possible damage better. There
            are some cases where ultrasound showed nothing and fibroscan showed
            F3 fibrosis.
          </FAQItem>
          <FAQItem title="What is Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)">
            Measures current immune response against the virus. ALT level goes
            high when the immune system starts attacking the infected liver
            cells.
          </FAQItem>
          <FAQItem title="What is Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)">
            Measures liver cancer risk. If this is high, it indicates there is a
            risk you have liver cancer. This has to be confirmed by other
            methods (like ultrasound) because there may be other reasons why AFP
            levels are high.
